# Lecture-Notes
This respository is a collection of various notes (or "lecture notes") that I have written up or collected over time. Usually for me to understand something deeply, I have to teach myself it--and this is a method of doing that.

What is contained in these lecture notes varies from S-matrix stuff to cosmology to maybe even some of the topics I am working on.
